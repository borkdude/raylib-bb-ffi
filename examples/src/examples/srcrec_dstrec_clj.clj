  "raylib [textures] example - source and destination rectangles

   One draw-texture-pro! call doing four things at once: picking a single
   frame out of a spritesheet (source rect), scaling it to fit a screen
   rect (destination rect), rotating it, and doing that rotation about a
   chosen origin rather than the corner. The two grey lines mark the
   destination's x and y, which is where the origin puts the pivot.

   Difficulty: 2/4
   Based on: textures/textures_srcrec_dstrec.c"
